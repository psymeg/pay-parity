## Introduction

The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an international non-governmental organization based in Switzerland, best known for convening global leaders at its annual meeting in Davos to discuss pressing economic, social, and political issues. One of its flagship publications is the Global Gender Gap Report, which benchmarks gender-based disparities across countries in four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. The report draws on a wide range of internationally recognized data sources, including national statistics offices, the International Labour Organization (ILO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and proprietary WEF surveys such as the Executive Opinion Survey. These datasets are synthesized to produce standardized indices, allowing meaningful cross-country comparisons and tracking of gender parity trends over time.

With the recent decision in New Zealand to scrap attempts to promote pay parity, the  Global Gender Gap Report which has detailed indicators on economic participation, including wage equality for similar work, provides a useful source of data to analyse what sort of impact this change might have on the New Zealand economy going forward.

# Filter for Wage equality indicator (2022)
payparity_data <- gender_gap_data %>%
  filter(Indicator == "Global Gender Gap Report: Wage equality between women and men for similar work", gender_gap_data$`Attribute 1` == "Index") %>%

#get nz pay parity
nz_pay_parity <- payparity_focus %>%
  filter(country == "New Zealand") %>%
  pull(pay_parity)

# Rank all countries by pay parity descending (1 = best)
payparity_ranked <- merged_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(pay_parity)) %>%
  distinct(country, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%     # Ensures 1 row per country
  arrange(desc(pay_parity)) %>%
  mutate(rank = row_number())

# Pull NZ's pay parity and rank cleanly
nz_row <- payparity_ranked %>%
  filter(country == "New Zealand")

nz_pay_parity <- nz_row$pay_parity
nz_rank <- nz_row$rank
total_countries <- nrow(payparity_ranked)
```

As we can see from the above graph, New Zealand ranks a lot lower than the majority of the countries looked at. New Zealand's gender pay parity score in 2022 was `r round(nz_pay_parity, 2)`, ranking `r nz_rank` out of `r total_countries` countries globally according to the World Economic Forum.

  distinct(country, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%

  labforce_focus <- labforce_data %>%
  filter(country %in% focus_countries) %>%

       x = "Country", y = "Labour Force Participation (Index 0-1)")

p3

# Save as PNG (optional)
ggsave("labforce_participation_bar.png", p3, width = 8, height = 5)

```

```{r graph-p2,  echo=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
merged_focus <- merged_data %>%
  filter(country %in% focus_countries) %>%
  distinct(country, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%     # Ensures 1 row per country
  filter(!is.na(pay_parity), !is.na(life_expectancy))

p2 <- ggplot(merged_focus, aes(x = life_expectancy, y = pay_parity)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country), size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = country), hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1, size = 3.5) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  labs(title = "Pay Parity vs Life Expectancy (2022) - Selected Countries",
       subtitle = "Data: WEF Global Gender Gap Report & World Bank",
       y = "Pay Parity (0 = low, 1 = full parity)",

ggsave("pay_parity_vs_lifeexp_selected.png", plot = p2, width = 8, height = 5, dpi = 300)
knitr::include_graphics("pay_parity_vs_lifeexp_selected.png")

```    

We can see New Zealand is middling, off the pace in terms of both Pay Parity and Life Expectancy with Singapore clearly the winner. 

```{r graph-payparity-time,  echo=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE}

  filter(Indicator == "Global Gender Gap Report: Wage equality between women and men for similar work",
         `Attribute 1` == "Index",
         `Economy Name` %in% focus_countries) %>%
  select(country = `Economy Name`,
         iso3c = `Economy ISO3`,
         `2006`:`2022`) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `2006`:`2022`, names_to = "year", values_to = "pay_parity") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(pay_parity))

p_payparity_trend <- ggplot(payparity_timeseries, aes(x = year, y = pay_parity, color = country)) +
   geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
   geom_point(size = 1.5) +
   theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
   labs(title = "Wage Equality Index Over Time (Selected Countries)",
        subtitle = "Source: WEF Global Gender Gap Report",
        x = "Year",
        y = "Pay Parity (0 = low, 1 = full parity)",
        colour = "Country")
 
print(p_payparity_trend)

```
