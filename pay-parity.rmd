## Why Pay Parity Matters: Exploring the Broader Impact

Recent politically motivated moves in New Zealand to roll back efforts aimed at achieving pay parity have sparked renewed debate over the true value of wage equality. I thought it would be interesting to take a look at where New Zealand stands currently in relation to other countries. Also I wanted to see if beyond the moral imperative of fairness, pay parity between men and women has and correlatation to economic performance, social wellbeing, and national resilience. After a quick search I found The World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report which has a rich dataset that provides detailed statistical data regarding wage equality, labor force participation, education, and health outcomes. By examining this data, we can start to understand how gender pay parity correlates with broader societal indicators such as life expectancy, crime, and economic opportunity. This raises important questions about what Kiwis stands to gain or lose by stepping back from parity.

  filter(country == "New Zealand")

nz_pay_parity <- nz_row$pay_parity
nz_rank <- nz_row$rank

```

As shown in the bar chart above, New Zealand ranks relatively lowly in wage equality for similar work compared to other developed economies. This is especially striking given the country’s progressive reputation and historical efforts in gender equality such as being the first country in the world to give women the vote. The data suggests that other nations, for example, Korea, France, and Japan, are making greater progress in regards to pay parity despite facing their own systemic challenges. 

New Zealand's gender pay parity score in 2022 was `r round(nz_pay_parity, 2)`, ranking `r nz_rank` out of `r total_countries` countries globally according to the World Economic Forum.

We can see New Zealand is middling, off the pace in terms of both Pay Parity and Life Expectancy with Singapore clearly the winner.

```
Looking at trends over time, we can see countries taking different paths. While some countries have steadily improved, others like New Zealand appear to have plateaued or even regressed. This visual reinforces the idea that policy decisions are important. Countries that commit to closing the wage gap often see tangible progress, with those that stall falling behind their peers.
